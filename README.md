A bunch of utility scripts

---

## heicToJpeg
Apple phones save images as .heic format, this caused some issues when I tried to upload some photos. This script converts .heic to .jpeg format. 

## img2pdf
I needed to upload some photos as a PDF. This script taskes a folder of photos and creates a PDF.

## pdfmerge
Creates a single PDF by merging folder of PDFs together.
